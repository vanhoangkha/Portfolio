## Setting Up Workflows

### First Time Setup

1. **Enable GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Click on "Actions" → "General"
   - Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"

2. **Add Secrets:**
   ```
   Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
   ```

3. **Configure Branch Protection:**
   ```
   Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule
   ```
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require linear history

### Testing Workflows Locally

Use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test workflows locally:

```bash
# Install act
brew install act  # macOS
# or
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Run CI workflow
act push

# Run specific job
act -j lint

# List available workflows
act -l
```

---

## Workflow Customization

### Adding New Jobs

Edit workflow files in `.github/workflows/`:

```yaml
jobs:
  your-job-name:
    name: Your Job Display Name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Your Step
        run: your-command
```

### Conditional Execution

Run jobs only on specific conditions:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    # ... job steps
```

### Using Outputs

Pass data between jobs:

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    outputs:
      version: ${{ steps.get-version.outputs.version }}
    steps:
      - id: get-version
        run: echo "version=1.0.0" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  job2:
    needs: job1
    steps:
      - run: echo ${{ needs.job1.outputs.version }}
```

## Best Practices

### Security
- Never commit secrets to workflow files
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Limit workflow permissions
- Review third-party actions

### Performance
- Cache dependencies with `actions/cache`
- Use matrix builds for parallel testing
- Skip unnecessary jobs with conditions
- Use `continue-on-error` for non-critical steps

### Maintenance
- Keep actions up to date
- Review workflow runs regularly
- Monitor action usage limits
- Document custom workflows

---

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails

1. Check workflow run logs in Actions tab
2. Verify all required secrets are set
3. Test locally with `act`
4. Check for syntax errors in YAML

### Deployment Issues

1. Verify AWS credentials are valid
2. Check S3 bucket permissions
3. Verify CloudFront distribution ID
4. Check AWS region configuration

### Permission Errors

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  deployments: write
```

Add appropriate permissions to workflow.
